AUGUSTUS S. ROE,
SOLICITOR & NOTARY.

A.B.C. Code 4th Ed.
Moreing & Neal's New Mining Code.

Roebourne,
Western Australia

My dear Aubrey

A very general wish has been expressed by the public to be allowed to perpetuate your fathers memory by some solid and substantial memorial, either to be erected over him where he lies, or to take such other form as your mother & yourselves should wish. Will you please submit this to your mother & obtain her sanction as I wish to take the matter in hand at once.

Yours affc.

Aug S Roe Esq.
