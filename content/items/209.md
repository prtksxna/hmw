description: |
  Letter from Bill Byron to Aubrey Hall, containing two poems and a short message.
  The poems are *The Man with the Hoe* by Edwin Markham (1852–1940) and *My Madonna* by Robert W. Service (1874–1958).
  Possibly written around the time of Aubrey's marriage, when Aubrey was in Busselton and presumably Bill was still in Cossack.
  Certainly written after the end of 1909, as the poems were all taken from the 24 December 1909 issue of thje London newspaper *T.P.'s Weekly*.
  Written on the back of *Roebourne Road Board* paper.
