## Transcription

Alec McRae & H.A. Hall both of Roebourne always their hats like this. Both were short maybe they wanted to appear taller

Memo

[?] photograph enlarged that you gave to Late Prince. Taken with Mrs. Alan Kopke I think.
Thought (me Joan Hall) Mrs Salem might like one. Humphrey Essington (Sr O'Reilly's [?]).

This is to show H. Aubrey Hall's hat worn in the Canadian Mountie style.
