      Inscription by Margaret Hall: 8 Outram St. West Perth. Where Judy & I lived for nine years (which included all the War II).
      I rented it from Ernest Hall for 35/- a week. The house had been made into two flats.
      During that time Winnie had 3 flats built on the tennis court. Later the house is a very good eating house.
