  Joan and Pat in uniform, probably taken in Cottesloe at Pat's parents' home in Forrest Street.

Note from Joan Jessup, Pat's daughter (18 May 2020):

> I suspect it is taken in Cottesloe, perhaps at my Grandparentâ€™s home in Forrest Street.
> It's not at their Broome Street residence as they didn't have a picket fence at that home.
> The pine trees would support that thought.
