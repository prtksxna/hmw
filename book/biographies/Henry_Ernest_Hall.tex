\biohead{Henry Ernest Hall}{}

Henry Ernest Hall was born in 1869.

Around 1904 he was managing the station and went to shoot a bullock for meat but when the animal charged him he managed to shoot himself in the leg and was left lame for life.
The doctor (a Catholic, Dr.~Mansell) charged him \pounds 100 to treat the wound, and despite the high price managed to set it badly.

In about 1916 he moved to Jarmen Island off the coast of Cossack to join his brother  \bioref{Harold_Aubrey_Hall} as a lighthouse keeper.\cite{Connie1983}  

He died in 1941.
