Engaged in Rhodesia

An engagement of local interest this week took place in Northern Rhodesia, the lass being Pat Walrond,
well known and popular in Perth's nursing fraternity.
Visiting friends and moving from place to place with plans for England drawing her northward,
she came to Mufulira in Northern Rhodesia,
and took a position as receptionist in the office of the copper mines.

There she met Derrick Robertson, of Johannesburg, and decided to abandon the English venture in favour of a home on the mines.
